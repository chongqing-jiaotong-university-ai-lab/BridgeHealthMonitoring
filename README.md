## Bridge Structure and Health Monitoring Ontology  

The bshm.owl file contains the semantic schema which can be used to represent the domain knowledge of bridge structure, bridge SHM systems and sensory data, etc. The BSHM ontology is built on top of the W3C recommended SSN and SOSA ontologies.  

In addition to the schema, two actual monitored bridges have been employed as use cases. Some bridge entities, structural regions, members and elements have been modeled. Besides that, two bridge SHM systems have been modeled as well. The installation information and some sample sensory data have been contained in the sample instances.
The BSHM ontology is extensible. We will update the ontology from time to time.
